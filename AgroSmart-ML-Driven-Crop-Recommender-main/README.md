# AgroSmart : ML Driven Crop Recommender

## Introduction 🔍
Farmers struggle with unpredictable weather, market shifts, and outdated methods in choosing crops. 
AgroSmart uses machine learning to analyze local soil, climate, and crop data, providing precise recommendations to boost yield, profitability, and sustainability.

## Features 🎯
 - Crop Recommendations: Uses Random Forest algorithm to suggest  the most suitable crop based on input conditions.

 - Yield Prediction: Implements Decision Tree to estimate crop yield accurately.

 - Fertilizers Recommendations: Employs Random Forest algorithm to recommend the best fertilizer for optimal crop growth.

 - Weather Prediction: Fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

 - Language Translation: Leverages Google Translate API to provide multilingual support for users.

 - Analysis: Visualizes data insights using bar graphs and pie charts for better understanding.

## Technology Stack 💻
- Frontend – HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

- Backend – PHP, Python Flask.

- Machine Learning – Random Forest, Decision Tree.

- Datasets – Kaggle datasets for crop, fertilizers, yeild   and       analysis.

## How It Works 🚀
 - User Inputs: Collects data like soil type, weather conditions, crop details, or datasets, with multilingual support via Google Translate API.

 - AI-Powered Analysis: Uses Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms for crop recommendations, yield prediction, and fertilizer suggestions.

 - Real-Time Weather Integration: Retrieves current weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API to guide agricultural planning.

 - Visualization: Provides insights through bar graphs and pie charts for easy understanding of trends and patterns.

 - Actionable Insights: Delivers tailored recommendations and predictions to optimize farming practices and improve productivity.
